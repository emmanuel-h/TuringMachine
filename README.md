# TuringMachine

    You just have to give the numbr of states, they will be automatically
    created from q0 to qn, with qyes state in addition.

    Transitions have to be typed according to this pattern :"q0 q1 a b lsr"
    which means : A transition from state q0 to q1 change the a value into b.
    lsr is the movement (l = left, s = stay, r = right).
